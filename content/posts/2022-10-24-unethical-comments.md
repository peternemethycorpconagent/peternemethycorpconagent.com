> "So you're saying you are a terrorist and you're willing to put up slanderous information about somebody and then if they retaliate against you and put a judgment against you and take all of the proceeds you may have coming you are OK with that right just a hypothetical situation because like I said in the past your best thinking got you to where you are just saying just thinking out of the box Right"

> "I'm just saying you did a great job when you hired me I've spoken to many judges many attorneys in cases just like this that one or the other has started the process and then what they do is they turn the entire process over to me and a judge or an attorney at that point it is not the owner and we make the decision. So actually it is up to you"

### Peter Nemethy - Realtor Remax - Text - Monday, October 24, 2022 11:49 AM - Response to suspicion Peter Nemethy is pushing us take less from the other people paying him
> "If you can prove that I will give you more money than you've ever made in your entire life And I have this deal with every agent that has looked at your home❓ this is what you're saying❓ if that's what you think you definitely are not in touch with reality‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️"

> "I think he will find out later that as a result of your divorce you have to sell the house and I think you're finding out that you are in foreclosure so the reality of it is your best thinking I got you exactly where you are today good night"

### Peter Nemethy - Realtor Remax - Text - Friday, October 21, 2022 8:45 PM 
> "like I've said numerous times you are not even understanding your situation regardless of what you say or think you can hire a handyman to come in you're still not gonna get what you want it's not a handyman this is why an investor was interested in your house so they can take everything out and put everything back in let us know You wanted to be educated so I sent you information from the Pinellas Realtor's organization obviously that didn't help you wanted to be kept in the loop so I told you the feedback from the last two showings obviously that didn't help no you want to see things happen in your benefit but people are not blind to the reality of the market."

> "after another one of your stupid comments of not trusting me we don't need to meet I don't need them waste my time with you in person if you want to talk to me you can call me and we can discuss this over the phone and if you would like your wife can be on the same conversation with us because you're talking to the wrong person about sympathy And telling me about your family and all of the things that you want to do while you don't have a job and you are behind on your payments to the bank I'm in the wrong guy for sympathy I am just doing my job representing you and your wife I am a transaction broker and I am facilitating a transaction. That's it. As far as getting a handyman you honestly are missing the entire picture of what this entire situation is around you it doesn't matter who you talk to the end result is going to be the same and "you are not going to like the results"

### Peter Nemethy - Realtor Remax - Text - Friday, October 21, 2022 8:05 PM 
> "Do you wanted me to keep you updated and educated I've been doing that so don't be mad at me again the information you can follow up with those agents if you would like and you can talk to them directly I have no problem with that actually let me send you some pictures of the inside of your house and you tell me if this house is worth ...""

### Peter Nemethy - Realtor Remax - Text - Friday, October 21, 2022 7:44 PM - 4 days after refusing initial offer of $685k dropped to $620k after inspection listing multiple non issues Peter oversaw
> "Just some feedback I want to share with you the couple that Joe you got along well with they are thinking of offering somewhere in the 380 K range and the other couple that is coming back for a second look tomorrow they are thinking of being in the 500 range just an FYI on feedback on those two showings ."

### Peter Nemethy - Realtor Remax - Text - Tuesday, October 17, 2022 8:09 PM 
> "So I'm letting you know I just spoke with the agent today is the deadline he is sending an email to the effect that they are not willing to budge and it's either way except their offer as is or it is canceled and we can start from the beginning. And if you remember when hurricane in was well below Cuba and you couldn't make a decision Joe that offer that came in was exactly what this offer is and then those people never came back to the table‼️ So with that being said Joe it is up to you what happens in which direction we go‼️ in my professional opinion of selling close to 1000 houses and having over 1000 transactions I would think this would be a decent deal because you don't know when the next one is going to come along and how much slower it will be keeping in mind the looming Foreclosure.""

### Peter Nemethy - Realtor Remax - Text - Tuesday, October 17, 2022 6:02 PM 
> "That I don't know what you're missing all I know is you need a week to think about something and then you don't do it example the line behind the house‼️ You're comparing 7% interest rates to a 3% interest rate"

> "Do you think the market is going up in reality it is at a standstill and going backwards"

> "That's just a few things that you are missing and not taking into consideration while you're trying to profit on a house that needs a lot of aesthetic work to even bring it up to today's standards of living"

> "You're worried about painting baseboards brown that are falling apart everywhere aren't even pieced together correctly"

> "Do you have three lights in the kitchen that don't work that doesn't seem to phase you one bit"

> "People that have money I have earned their money they're not going to waste it on a project house like this is in this time of the market. The people that finance don't really care because they haven't worked for their money so they're just borrowing somebody else's money.""

### Peter Nemethy - Realtor Remax - Text - Tuesday, October 17, 2022 5:57 PM  
> "It's very difficult when you're talking to someone that is speaking absolute nonsense and is not in touch with the real world of what's going on around them."

### Peter Nemethy - Realtor Remax - Text - Tuesday, October 17, 2022 5:50 PM  
> "And do you think they're millionaires because they have wasted their money on over priced items like houses❓ if they have a money that means they're smart they're not idiots to throw their money away think about it‼️"

### Peter Nemethy - Realtor Remax - Text - Tuesday, October 17, 2022 5:47 PM  
> "I am not going to argue with you because you always want to be right so we will do whatever you want maybe we should raise the price since people just are all walking around with cash and are all millionaires"

### Peter Nemethy - Realtor Remax - Text - Tuesday, October 17, 2022 5:37 PM  
> "you need to get yourself educated on interest rates and how they affect the market each time they go up your price comes down. And keep in mind your best thinking got you where are you are today."

### Peter Nemethy - Realtor Remax - Text - Tuesday, October 17, 2022 5:35 PM  
> "I've spoken with the agent so basically we're gonna be putting the house back on the market after all you went through for no reason at all like the hurricane"

### Peter Nemethy - Realtor Remax - Text - Saturday, October 15, 2022 5:48 PM - 3 days after inspection, and at least one day after inspectors were closed for business Friday, and having previously sent us several emails
> "They are waiting on the appraisal but they are still asking for this reduction due to the amount of work that it needs like I said we can try to counter I just spoke with the agent and I will leave that up to you guys we may be able to get a couple dollars out of them but I can't guarantee anything. Please send me your emails so I can email this addendum and inspection report over to you" 

### Peter Nemethy - Realtor Remax - Text - Saturday, October 15, 2022 5:37 PM  
> "They spoke to the agent in depth about this because I was a little surprised at how high they came in on the price. So I think this is their ammo to start with. With that being said we can counter he said they will either work with us a little bit or they will totally walk away. I can ask him if they could reduce that a little bit and see where we go or leave it alone but this one is going to be up to you guys. I don't want to mess up or say something wrong to jeopardize this transaction."

### Peter Nemethy - Realtor Remax - Text - Saturday, October 15, 2022 5:17 PM   
> "So after all is said and done the buyer is asking for a $65,000 reduction in the price and they will close according to the contract if you are OK with this we will send over the addendum for your signatures and we can move forward please let me know.""

### Peter Nemethy - Realtor Remax - Text - Wednesday, October 12, 2022 11:52 AM 
> "This is the most thorough inspection that I have ever seen in my life on anything it truly is amazing how many inspections they are doing and they are being so thorough on all of these but I would say by Monday we will know where we are with these folks these inspections or not for free they certainly are spending a lot of money on going through the house so they do not want any surprises"

### Peter Nemethy - Realtor Remax - Text - Wednesday, October 11, 2022 2:33 PM
> "You will have the appraisal and swimming pool inspection tomorrow at 10 AM the buyer would appreciate if the home was vacant please confirm that you have received this message"

### Peter Nemethy - Realtor Remax - Text - Sunday, September 25, 2022 3:00 PM
> "sent you the pre-Qual letter you also have the lenders information how much more information are you looking for no one is rushing anyone it's a much better offer than we had the other day the only difference is one is financing and the other one was cash also you wanted to rush it and close on Monday which was impossible to do in my opinion this is a superior offer the only difference is these folks have not seen the house which I had said a couple text messages ago that would be my only concern not the storm not the price not the wire in the backyard because we know that is cable. It's been my experience that if buyers and sellers overthink the process at the end they will always lose."

### Peter Nemethy - Realtor Remax - Text - Saturday, September 24, 2022 9:46 AM
> "You don't have to worry about the power you don't have to worry about the storm there isn't anything to concern I would be more concerned about getting your personal property out of the house than anything else because you have furniture and personal belongings that need to go somewhere I would start lining that up. And if the storm takes the house away you guys have insurance if the storm doesn't take the house you have a buyer so either way it's gonna be a win-win for you.""

### Peter Nemethy - Realtor Remax - Text - Saturday, September 24, 2022 9:30 AM
> "I don't get frustrated with anything believe me it doesn't matter to me if it sells today or if it sells in eight months from now it honestly doesn't matter so I give you feedback what the other people have said while they were inside the house that is constructive criticism Nothing negative we can raise the price if you want to but after talking to this agent that was the best they were going to do with that being said I have a call into him and a text message to see if I can't get them up to your number"

### Peter Nemethy - Realtor Remax - Text - Saturday, September 24, 2022 9:30 AM
> "You mean the guys name? Why would you have to deal with the storm? Well we could wait for a financing deal then you can wait 45 days and then they cancel for numerous reasons appraisal inspections didn't qualify or go with a sure deal of cash"

### Peter Nemethy - Realtor Remax - Text - Friday, September 23, 2022 11:23 AM
> "It's all good you will be there and take care of this guy"
> "can you confirm that you will be doing the showing for this agent or I have to stop what I'm doing right now and run down there"
> "there is a another couple that just called me they have an agent they want to come over right now to look at the house so I hope you are there to let them in thank you"

### Peter Nemethy - Realtor Remax - Text - Friday, September 23, 2022 10:24 AM
> "this agent that is coming at noon is only doing a video with a buyer that is out of state do you want me there or is this something that you can handle
> "I would just love him and show him the house real quick and then let him do his video conference call with potential buyer"

### Peter Nemethy - Realtor Remax - Text - Wednesday, September 21, 2022 1:58 PM
> "This was the agent that was doing a video with the buyer after coming through the house and getting a tour first she never called the buyer and said this was not going to work for them she said that the pictures online and in person looked different so she did not want to waste the buyers time I am sorry I'm sure there will be others"

### Peter Nemethy - Realtor Remax - Text 
> "Perhaps the attorneys can ask the judge to make these decisions in both of yours best interests and you won't have to worry about doing that that's also been done in the past then it just takes you out of it and the court decides what offer they're going to go with"

### Peter Nemethy - Realtor Remax - Text 
> "My ethics are fine The problem is when you have a non-compliant seller that says one thing and does another. At the end of the day nothing is going to change you're still going to have to move. You're still getting a divorce. You were still in foreclosure. And all of that comes from your best thinking. I'm just saying. I am not the one you need to be mad at your self MoveOn instead of trying to drag everybody down."

### Peter Nemethy - Realtor Remax - Text 
> "we are out of contract since the Buyers sent in the cancellation just out of respect to them could you please sign it and send it back these are all good practice runs for you so when we do get a another contract hopefully there is no hurricane you will be able to sign it in a timely fashion and providing the next inspection better for us you can also sign that one in a timely fashion but for now if you could just sign this so the money can be released from the escrow account back to the buyers"

### Peter Nemethy - Realtor Remax - Text 
> "you are wrong in your perspective of the market you are wrong about me not wanting you there you are wrong about everything why don't you reach out to the other agent again and perhaps he can explain it to you why you are not welcome to be at those inspections‼️"

### Peter Nemethy - Realtor Remax - Text 
> "reach out to the inspectors and ask them why you were not at the inspection reach out to the swimming pool guy ask him why you were not at the inspection reach out to your ex-wife when her and I were talking outside to the other agent and ask her why you were not at the inspection no one from the other side wanted you at the inspection after you screaming jumping up and downs and waving your hands around does any of that help please verify with everyone I stated"
