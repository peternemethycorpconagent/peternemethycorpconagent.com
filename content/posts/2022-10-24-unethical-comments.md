> "So you're saying you are a terrorist and you're willing to put up slanderous information about somebody and then if they retaliate against you and put a judgment against you and take all of the proceeds you may have coming you are OK with that right just a hypothetical situation because like I said in the past your best thinking got you to where you are just saying just thinking out of the box Right"

> "I'm just saying you did a great job when you hired me I've spoken to many judges many attorneys in cases just like this that one or the other has started the process and then what they do is they turn the entire process over to me and a judge or an attorney at that point it is not the owner and we make the decision. So actually it is up to you"

### Peter Nemethy - Realtor Remax - Text - Monday, October 24, 2022 11:49 AM - Response to suspicion Peter Nemethy is pushing us take less from the other people paying him
> "If you can prove that I will give you more money than you've ever made in your entire life And I have this deal with every agent that has looked at your home❓ this is what you're saying❓ if that's what you think you definitely are not in touch with reality‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️"

> "I think he will find out later that as a result of your divorce you have to sell the house and I think you're finding out that you are in foreclosure so the reality of it is your best thinking I got you exactly where you are today good night"

> "like I've said numerous times you are not even understanding your situation regardless of what you say or think you can hire a handyman to come in you're still not gonna get what you want it's not a handyman this is why an investor was interested in your house so they can take everything out and put everything back in let us know You wanted to be educated so I sent you information from the Pinellas Realtor's organization obviously that didn't help you wanted to be kept in the loop so I told you the feedback from the last two showings obviously that didn't help no you want to see things happen in your benefit but people are not blind to the reality of the market."

> "after another one of your stupid comments of not trusting me we don't need to meet I don't need them waste my time with you in person if you want to talk to me you can call me and we can discuss this over the phone and if you would like your wife can be on the same conversation with us because you're talking to the wrong person about sympathy And telling me about your family and all of the things that you want to do while you don't have a job and you are behind on your payments to the bank I'm in the wrong guy for sympathy I am just doing my job representing you and your wife I am a transaction broker and I am facilitating a transaction. That's it. As far as getting a handyman you honestly are missing the entire picture of what this entire situation is around you it doesn't matter who you talk to the end result is going to be the same and "you are not going to like the results"

> "Do you wanted me to keep you updated and educated I've been doing that so don't be mad at me again the information you can follow up with those agents if you would like and you can talk to them directly I have no problem with that actually let me send you some pictures of the inside of your house and you tell me if this house is worth ...""

### Peter Nemethy - Realtor Remax - Text - Friday, October 21, 2022 7:44 PM - 4 days after refusing initial offer of $685k dropped to $620k after inspection listing multiple non issues Peter oversaw
> "Just some feedback I want to share with you the couple that Joe you got along well with they are thinking of offering somewhere in the 380 K range and the other couple that is coming back for a second look tomorrow they are thinking of being in the 500 range just an FYI on feedback on those two showings ."

### Peter Nemethy - Realtor Remax - Text - Tuesday, October 17, 2022 8:09 PM 
> "So I'm letting you know I just spoke with the agent today is the deadline he is sending an email to the effect that they are not willing to budge and it's either way except their offer as is or it is canceled and we can start from the beginning. And if you remember when hurricane in was well below Cuba and you couldn't make a decision Joe that offer that came in was exactly what this offer is and then those people never came back to the table‼️ So with that being said Joe it is up to you what happens in which direction we go‼️ in my professional opinion of selling close to 1000 houses and having over 1000 transactions I would think this would be a decent deal because you don't know when the next one is going to come along and how much slower it will be keeping in mind the looming Foreclosure.""

> "That I don't know what you're missing all I know is you need a week to think about something and then you don't do it example the line behind the house‼️ You're comparing 7% interest rates to a 3% interest rate"

> "Do you think the market is going up in reality it is at a standstill and going backwards"

> "That's just a few things that you are missing and not taking into consideration while you're trying to profit on a house that needs a lot of aesthetic work to even bring it up to today's standards of living"

> "You're worried about painting baseboards brown that are falling apart everywhere aren't even pieced together correctly"

> "Do you have three lights in the kitchen that don't work that doesn't seem to phase you one bit"

> "People that have money I have earned their money they're not going to waste it on a project house like this is in this time of the market. The people that finance don't really care because they haven't worked for their money so they're just borrowing somebody else's money.""

> "It's very difficult when you're talking to someone that is speaking absolute nonsense and is not in touch with the real world of what's going on around them."

### Peter Nemethy - Realtor Remax - Text - Tuesday, October 17, 2022 5:50 PM  
> "And do you think they're millionaires because they have wasted their money on over priced items like houses❓ if they have a money that means they're smart they're not idiots to throw their money away think about it‼️"

### Peter Nemethy - Realtor Remax - Text - Tuesday, October 17, 2022 5:47 PM  
> "I am not going to argue with you because you always want to be right so we will do whatever you want maybe we should raise the price since people just are all walking around with cash and are all millionaires"

### Peter Nemethy - Realtor Remax - Text - Tuesday, October 17, 2022 5:37 PM  
> "you need to get yourself educated on interest rates and how they affect the market each time they go up your price comes down. And keep in mind your best thinking got you where are you are today."

### Peter Nemethy - Realtor Remax - Text - Tuesday, October 17, 2022 5:35 PM  
> "I've spoken with the agent so basically we're gonna be putting the house back on the market after all you went through for no reason at all like the hurricane"
