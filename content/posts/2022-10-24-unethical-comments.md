> Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

It's about people, then technology. Use the best tech tools free. This simple walkthrough will show and explain how.

## Checkout These dubs of dubs and Get dubs

You can do it!

You'll probably want to customize the look and feel to your site, and all that takes is changing a few, simple lines of code.

You can do it! Technojargon and geek speak can get annoying to even the most hardcore of us geeks. No one likes to be spoken to in a language they don't know unless they're learning that langauge and allowed to ease in comfortably, preferabbly, and most effectively, by immersion. Just like learning a -spoken language, or making music, or playing sports, the most significant obstacle to gaining skill is where to begin. There are just too many solution options, too many programming languages, too many buzz words, too much out out of date documentation online, too many varied opinions and recommendations, and too many possible layers in a "fullstack" app. The anydub video course will ease in with a quick tour of current software landscape. technical explanations, define and explain , then get right to putting those buzz words to real world use on your bad ass new website.

## Credit Due

anydub is currently substantially copied from another open source project, [anydub](http://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatby-starter-lumen), with additional features added. anydub is different. Our focus is teaching and demonstrating how to implement these amazing technologies, and in further developing and adding features to anydub. If you're willing and open minded enough to follow along and have installed three development tools on your computer, register for two cloud accounts, and follow along typing (or pasting) a few commands and changing a few lines of code, then by following this guide, written and explained with plain english, in one hour you'll establish a modern, extensible, online presence with your new, free website.

If you're not interested in learning anything about code, this guide and the anydub CMS are still for you. Technojargon and geek speak can get annoying to even the most hardcore of us geeks. No one likes to be spoken to in a language they don't know unless they're learning that langauge and allowed to ease in comfortably, preferabbly, and most effectively, by immersion. Just like learning a spoken language, or making music, or playing sports, the most significant obstacle to gaining skill is where to begin. There are just too many solution options, too many programming languages, too many buzz words, too much out out of date documentation online, too many varied opinions and recommendations, and too many possible layers in a "fullstack" app.

It may seem like you'd have to be a masochist to want to solve all that with worth that can be as tedious, misunderstood, and unnappreciated as developing. The goal of anydub and the blog at apptain.com, is to develop, share, present, and teach a CMS to make your life easier and insightful, concise, lessons to share perspective and context. Because

The apptain blog and anydub template are tools for sharing and teaching through demonstration, in plain english. We'll immerse into the task of creating and publishing your website, and ease into technical explanations, with some quick definitions. Then get right to working with the technologies and tools. It won't be just technobabble anymore with context and purpose gained when the tools defined by the buzz words bring to life a real world, bad ass, extensible new website that you'll own completely forever.

## Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

The first line of the agile manifesto, maybe sounds strange to start a lesson and repo sharing a bunch of technologies and tools, but valuing individuals and interactions is exactly the natural goal of a CMS. While all of these technologies have strong benefits over other industry comparable options, and even turn their weaknesses into strengths with easy automated builds and staticly generated sites , the netlify jamstack CMS is the most valuable and flexible piece of software being demonstrated. A lightweight, configuration based, react CMS that uses a git repo in lieu of database and for source control is a game changer,

## Technical Documentation

If you are new to coding, it is recommended to follow along with the video walkthough for an in depth explanations and demonstration of the technologies discussed and demonstrated in this code.

This app is built with gatsby, netlify cms, react javascript, node, graphql, netlify jamstack cms, jamstack, and git. Look ma, no database!
