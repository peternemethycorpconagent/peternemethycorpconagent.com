We signed a right to represent to agreement with Peter to represent us as our real estate agent to sell our home in Clearwater, FL. Last month, one Friday (will find specific date), he asked that we be host interested buyers ourselves one day, as was indisposed. That seemed non-standard, but my wife left work to host the supposedly interested buyers. We received an offer from one one of those buyers agents, his clients supposedly moving to Clearwater from California. When asked about the buyers' qualifications to purchase, Peter's answer by telephone was to the affects that if I must know, they are pre-qualified up to $33 million. 

When the offer came in, central Florida was just under the threat of hurricane Ian and the models had recently updated and predicted coming right towards us as category 4 with the worst possible path for the Tampa Bay area. When I stated a desire to see what happens with the hurricane before signing the contract, Peter responded by saying with the affect that was I being silly to prepare and was skeptical of the reports or the danger. Luckily for our area, he was correct. Still we did a significant amount draining the pool and preparing the house for the potential storm. The weekend after the storm had passed, Peter notified us Sunday that the property inspection would be the next day, on Monday. 

Will finish telling the story soon, but the quotes, even though a good number are still missing there, tell the story and give one a feel for the professionalism of Peter Nemethy comprehensively through and through.
